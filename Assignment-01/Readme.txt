I have tried to simplify things for your grading.

------Motion Planning Application------
I have included the links to the papers in the discussion forum.

To run the file, directly run it from the terminal.
I have currently deviated the turtle by an angle of 5degrees so it covers the entire circle in 12-13 loops. 
However, I could do better to include the entire circle into it by reducing the angle to 0.1 degrees and the main for loop's range to 601.

------Ros2_Trtlesim------
My Ubuntu screen recording frame rate lost its shame in the middle and hence I have appended a screenshot of the same for your understanding.  

------Obstacle_Field_Demonstration------
After running the file from terminal, you iwll need to input coverage from the command window. The coverage will be of the form 10 or 50 or 70.
Please do not divide them by 100 when inputing.

------Discussion_Board_post------
Nothing much in this one, I have already introduced myself.
